## Contributing

Contributions to Recap are welcome, provided they align with the project’s intent.

Recap is intentionally minimal and utility-focused. Its goal is to support structured reference-building without expanding into a broad productivity platform.

If you are interested in contributing, useful areas include:

- improvements to clarity, structure, or consistency
- bug fixes and edge-case handling
- UI and accessibility refinements
- performance or reliability improvements
- small, well-scoped feature additions that preserve the project’s philosophy

Before proposing larger changes, please consider opening an issue to discuss intent and scope.

By contributing, you agree to respect the project’s design principles and non-commercial license.
